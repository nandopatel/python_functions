#This is the solution for practice Exercise 1

#1) Write a program in python to print out the number of seconds in a 30 day month
#30 days, 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes per day, 60 seconds in a minute
print(30*24*60*60)

#2) Write a program in python to print out the number of seconds in a year
print(365*24*60*60)

#3) Use python as a calculator.
print(84*45)
print(75/15)
print(90-34)
print(23+45)

#4) A high speed train can travel at an average speed of 150 mph, how long will it take a
# train travelling at this speed to travel from London to Glasgow which is 414 miles
# away?
#    Give your answer in minutes
print( (414/150)*60)

#5) Using the help facility on python. Type help() to start the online facility, then keywords
#to view the keywords that are available in python. Get help on the “if” keyword.
help("keyword")

#6) Use the interpreter to execute the following:
#a. 49 / 7
#b. 8**2
#c. 20%3
#d. 17 // 3
#e. 7**3

print(49/7)
print(8**2)
print(20%3)
print(17//3)
print(7**3)

#7) Use python to evaluate the following:
#a. If you are going on holiday to France how much
#Euros would you get when you convert £500 at an exchange rate of £1 = €1.20.
print(500*1.20)

#b. On return from your holiday you now have €320,
#how much GBP would you receive at an exchange rate of £1 = €1.32. Use python to calculate this.
print(320/1.32)

#8) The volume of a sphere is given by V = (4/3)pi*r^3, use python to find the
#volume of a sphere with a radius of 10 cm.
print((4/3)*22/7*10**3)

#9)Insert brackets in the expression 36/9-2 to get:
#)a. 2
print( (36/9)-2 )

#)b. 5.12
print( 36/(9-2) )
