#1) Write a program that assigns the variables length and width to be 18 and 7
#respectively.  Use the variables to calculate the perimeter and area
#of the rectangle. 
length = 18
width = 7
perimeter = (2*length) + (2*width)
print(perimeter)

#2) Write a python program that defines a variable called days_in_each_school_year
#and assign 192 to the variable.  The program should then print out the total hours
#that you spend in school from year 7 to year 11, assuming that each day you spend
#6 hours in school
days_in_each_school_year = 192
print(5*days_in_each_school_year * 6)


#3) What value will be stored in marks:
marks = 25
marks = marks + 10
print(marks)



#4. Given the code below, what value will be printed to the screen? 
time_spent = 34 # in minutes
# after one minutes
time_spent = time_spent +1
print(time_spent)

#5. Which of the value below would be printed on the screen from the code snippet?
#hours_in_a_week = hours_in_a_day  * 7
#hours_in_a_month = hours_in_a_week * 30 # assuming we have 30 days in a month
#print (hours_in_a_month)

#d.	Error   --> hours_in_a_day is not defined and therefore will generate an error.

#6) What is the value of score after running the following code?
score = 24
number_of_pieces = 2
new_score = score *2
print(score)

#7) False:  An expression can be assigned to a variable.
#--> A variable can be assigned an expression, not the other way around.

#What is the value of y after running the code?
x, y = 23, 45
y, x = x, y
print(y)

#8) Which of the following are not valid python variable name?
#4gs	&item	_age		

#9) How do we use the help() function in python?
#by typing help() at the prompt


#10)Which of the following statements will assign the value 365 to the
#variable days_in_a_year ?

#c.	days in a year = 365
